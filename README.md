[Workshop website and schedule](http://icub.unibuc.ro/index.php?option=com_jevents&task=icalrepeat.detail&evid=70&Itemid=1&year=2016&month=10&day=18&title=natural-versus-anthropogenic-causes-of-climate-variability-and-feedback-from-bio-geo-chemical-processes-natclimvar&uid=2a1acec1cdc2c8679ea15fae3d739104&catids=49%7C50%7C51%7C52)

Sessions on Thursday 20th October 10:00-11:00 and 17:00-18:00. Two-part talk titled:

###  How to do stats without math, be a better researcher, and save your life with Python.

[Etherpad for collaborative note-taking](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/NATVARCLIM)

This talk will cover basic introduction to Bash and the role of statistics in a scientific project.
We will discuss how academic research currently has systemic flaws that encourage irreproducible
work, that result in the so-called "Reproducibility Crisis". A crisis that need-not exist.
We will examine how you, as early-stage researchers, can begin to break this anti-pattern through the
adoption of community open-source tools and computer-science methods, including the use
of Python. In this context, a basic introduction to meteorological station data analysis in Python will be
demonstrated, using the Pandas library. I will also demonstrate the use of remote, gridded
NetCDF datasets and simple mapping tools for multidimensional datasets.

This talk is for novices: no prior knowledge is required.
